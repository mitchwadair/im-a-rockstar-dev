Shout "Input a number"
Listen to the input

Split the input into an array
Let the length be an array
Put the length over 2 into half
Turn up half

The count is 0
Palindrome is true
Until the count is as high as half
Let the back be an array minus 1 minus the count
Put an array at the count into First
Put an array at the back into Second
If First without Second aint nothing
Palindrome is false
Break

Build the count up

Say Palindrome
